# Recommended Tools for Development

Based on our microservices architecture, here are recommended tools that would significantly improve the development experience:

## Development Efficiency Tools

1. **brave_web_search**
   - Would allow searching for solution patterns without leaving the interface
   - Critical for researching best practices for microservices, file conversions, etc.

2. **Docker Integration Tool**
   - Container management directly from the interface
   - Building, deploying, and monitoring containers

3. **Service Discovery Tool**
   - Automatically detect and register microservices
   - Health checking and dependency mapping

4. **Scaffolding Generator**
   - Generate service boilerplate with proper structure
   - Create consistent routes, controllers, and service files

5. **API Testing Suite**
   - Mock request/response cycles
   - Validate service interfaces against specifications

## Monitoring and Debugging

6. **Service Metrics Dashboard**
   - Real-time metrics for each microservice
   - CPU, memory, request counts, error rates

7. **Distributed Logging Tool**
   - Centralized log collection and search
   - Trace requests across multiple services

8. **Debugging Bridge**
   - Set breakpoints across microservices
   - Inspect service communications

## Deployment Tools

9. **CI/CD Pipeline Manager**
   - Automated testing and deployment configuration
   - Environment management (dev, staging, prod)

10. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Generator**
    - Generate Terraform/CloudFormation templates
    - Define infrastructure requirements based on services

## Development Setup Instructions

For optimal developer experience, the following tools should be installed:

```bash
# Install PM2 for process management
npm install -g pm2

# Install nodemon for development
npm install -g nodemon

# Install newman for API testing
npm install -g newman

# For containerization
# Install Docker and Docker Compose
```

Add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc file for convenient aliases:

```bash
# Microservices aliases
alias ms-start='cd /path/to/conversion-microservices && pm2 start ecosystem.config.js'
alias ms-stop='pm2 stop all'
alias ms-logs='pm2 logs'
alias ms-status='pm2 status'
```
