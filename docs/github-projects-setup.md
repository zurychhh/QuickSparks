# QuickSparks GitHub Projects Setup

This document outlines the configuration and usage of GitHub Projects for tracking tasks in the QuickSparks project. It provides a standardized approach to work management, ensuring consistent tracking and reporting.

## Project Structure

The QuickSparks project will use GitHub Projects with a structured approach that aligns with our milestone planning and task prioritization.

### Project Board

A single project board named "QuickSparks Development" will be created with the following configuration:

- **Visibility**: Organization-level project, visible to all team members
- **Template**: Custom (built from scratch)
- **URL**: `https://github.com/orgs/quicksparks/projects/1` (placeholder URL)

## Field Configuration

The project will use the following custom fields to track task metadata:

### Status Field

The Status field will use the following values to track the workflow stages:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| üìã Backlog | Task is defined but not yet ready for development |
| üîç Refinement | Task is being analyzed and refined for development |
| üöÄ Ready | Task is fully specified and ready for development |
| üèóÔ∏è In Progress | Task is currently being worked on |
| üëÄ Review | Task is completed and awaiting review/QA |
| ‚úÖ Done | Task is completed and meets all acceptance criteria |

### Priority Field

The Priority field will use MoSCoW prioritization:

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| üî¥ Must Have | Critical for MVP, must be completed |
| üü† Should Have | Important but not critical for initial launch |
| üü° Could Have | Desirable if resources permit |
| ‚ö™ Won't Have | Not planned for current development cycle |

### Effort Field

The Effort field will use T-shirt sizing to estimate work required:

| Size | Estimated Effort |
|------|------------------|
| XS | Less than 4 hours |
| S | 4-8 hours (1 day) |
| M | 1-2 days |
| L | 3-5 days |
| XL | 1-2 weeks |

### Risk Field

The Risk field will indicate potential implementation challenges:

| Risk Level | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| üî• High | Significant technical or business risks |
| üü° Medium | Moderate risks that need attention |
| üü¢ Low | Well-understood with minimal risk |

### Milestone Field

The Milestone field will associate tasks with project milestones:

| Milestone | Timeline |
|-----------|----------|
| Foundation Setup | Week 1 |
| Core Conversion | Week 2 |
| User Interface | Week 3 |
