## Resource Allocation

This section provides guidance on how to allocate resources based on task priorities.

### Task Effort Estimation

Effort is estimated using a T-shirt sizing approach:

- **XS**: Less than 4 hours
- **S**: 4-8 hours (1 day)
- **M**: 1-2 days
- **L**: 3-5 days
- **XL**: 1-2 weeks

### Priority-Based Resource Allocation

Resources should be allocated according to these guidelines:

1. **Must Have Features**
   - Assign at least 70% of available resources
   - Schedule early in the development timeline
   - Assign most experienced team members
   - Build in buffer time for unexpected issues

2. **Should Have Features**
   - Allocate approximately 20% of resources
   - Schedule after Must Have features are well underway
   - Consider parallel development where dependencies allow
   - Prepare for potential de-scoping if Must Have features encounter issues

3. **Could Have Features**
   - Allocate remaining 10% of resources
   - Schedule only when Must Have features are nearing completion
   - Consider implementing in parallel by team members with specific expertise
   - Be prepared to defer to post-launch

### Risk-Based Adjustments

Adjust resource allocation based on risk assessment:

- **High-Risk Components**: Allocate additional resources and start earlier
- **Uncertain Complexity**: Build in extra buffer time
- **External Dependencies**: Schedule with contingency time
- **New Technologies**: Allocate discovery/learning time

## Potential Bottlenecks and Risk Mitigation

This section identifies potential bottlenecks and strategies to address them.

### Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Conversion Quality**
   - **Risk**: Achieving high-quality conversion results might require more time than estimated
   - **Impact**: Could delay the core functionality completion
   - **Mitigation**: Begin with focused prototype testing of multiple libraries, establish quality baseline early

2. **Payment Integration**
   - **Risk**: PayByLink integration could encounter unexpected technical issues
   - **Impact**: Could delay the payment system implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Start integration early, develop fallback manual payment tracking system

3. **File Encryption Performance**
   - **Risk**: Encryption/decryption might impact performance more than expected
   - **Impact**: Could affect user experience and conversion times
   - **Mitigation**: Implement progressive encryption approach, optimize for most critical files first

4. **Frontend Performance**
   - **Risk**: Handling large files in the browser might cause performance issues
   - **Impact**: Could degrade user experience
   - **Mitigation**: Implement chunked upload/download, progressive rendering, and performance optimization early

### Contingency Planning

For each priority level, establish these contingency measures:

1. **Must Have Features**
   - Identify core vs. enhanced aspects within each feature
   - Prepare simplified implementations that can be enhanced later
   - Document minimum acceptable criteria for launch

2. **Should Have Features**
   - Prepare phased implementation approaches
   - Identify which aspects could be deferred to post-launch
   - Have clear criteria for go/no-go decisions

3. **Could Have Features**
   - Document implementation specifications for future development
   - Consider implementing as separate post-launch projects
   - Evaluate third-party solutions where applicable

## Sprint Planning Framework

This section provides a framework for planning development sprints based on prioritization.

### Sprint Allocation Guidelines

1. **Sprint 1-2 (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Focus: Foundation and Core Functionality
   - Allocation: 90% Must Have, 10% architectural work for Should Have
   - Goal: Complete foundation and conversion pipeline

2. **Sprint 3 (Week 3)**
   - Focus: User Interface and Experience
   - Allocation: 80% Must Have, 20% Should Have
   - Goal: Complete basic user interface and experience

3. **Sprint 4-5 (Weeks 4-5)**
   - Focus: Payment System and Security
   - Allocation: 70% Must Have, 25% Should Have, 5% Could Have
   - Goal: Complete payment integration and security implementation

4. **Sprint 6 (Week 6)**
   - Focus: Integration, Testing, and Optimization
   - Allocation: 50% Must Have completion, 40% Should Have, 10% Could Have
   - Goal: System integration, optimization, and launch preparation

### Sprint Sequencing Strategy

To maximize efficiency, follow these sequencing principles:

1. **Foundation First**: Establish core infrastructure before building features
2. **Vertical Slices**: Implement complete features from frontend to backend
3. **Risk-Based Ordering**: Address high-risk items earlier in the schedule
4. **Dependency-Driven**: Schedule tasks to minimize blocking dependencies
5. **Buffer Integration**: Include integration time between major components

## Task Tracking Implementation

This section outlines how task prioritization will be implemented in project management tools.

### GitHub Projects Configuration

Tasks will be tracked in GitHub Projects with these priority-based labels:

1. **Priority Labels**
   - `priority:must-have`: Critical for MVP
   - `priority:should-have`: Important but not critical
   - `priority:could-have`: Desirable if time permits
   - `priority:won't-have`: Future consideration

2. **Effort Labels**
   - `effort:xs`: Less than 4 hours
   - `effort:s`: 4-8 hours
   - `effort:m`: 1-2 days
   - `effort:l`: 3-5 days
   - `effort:xl`: 1-2 weeks

3. **Risk Labels**
   - `risk:high`: High-risk component
   - `risk:medium`: Medium-risk component
   - `risk:low`: Low-risk component

4. **Dependency Tags**
   - `blocks:#issue-number`: This issue blocks another
   - `blocked-by:#issue-number`: This issue is blocked by another

### Priority-Based Views

GitHub Projects will be configured with these views:

1. **Sprint Planning View**
   - Group by Sprint
   - Filter by assignee
   - Sort by priority

2. **Priority View**
   - Group by priority
   - Sort by effort and risk

3. **Dependency View**
   - Custom view showing dependency chains
   - Highlight critical path items

4. **Progress Tracking View**
   - Group by status
   - Show completion percentage by priority level

## Continuous Reprioritization Process

This section outlines the process for ongoing reprioritization as the project evolves.

### Reprioritization Triggers

Reprioritization should be considered when:

1. **Sprint Completion**: End of each sprint
2. **Technical Discovery**: New information about implementation complexity
3. **Risk Realization**: When identified risks materialize
4. **External Factors**: Changes in business requirements or market conditions

### Reprioritization Process

Follow this process for reprioritization:

1. **Impact Assessment**
   - Evaluate impact on project timeline
   - Identify affected dependencies
   - Quantify effort implications

2. **Adjustment Strategy**
   - Identify tasks that can be descoped
   - Evaluate resource reallocation options
   - Determine timeline adjustments

3. **Communication Plan**
   - Document reprioritization rationale
   - Update affected team members
   - Revise project documentation

4. **Implementation**
   - Update GitHub Projects labels and milestones
   - Adjust sprint allocations
   - Update dependency tracking

## Conclusion

This prioritization framework provides a structured approach to managing the QuickSparks implementation. By following the MoSCoW prioritization method, understanding dependencies, and implementing the suggested sprint planning framework, the team can focus on delivering the most critical features first while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.

The framework should be treated as a living document, with regular reviews and adjustments as the project progresses and new information becomes available.
