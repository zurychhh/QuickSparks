# QuickSparks Simplified MVP Architecture

This document outlines the simplified monolithic architecture for the QuickSparks MVP, designed for rapid implementation while maintaining a path toward future modularization.

## Architecture Overview

For the MVP, we'll use a simplified monolithic architecture that includes all core functionality in a single application while maintaining clear internal boundaries for future service separation.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Application Server

The foundation of our MVP is a single Express.js application that handles:

- HTTP API endpoints for all services
- File processing logic
- User management
- Payment processing integration
- Application state management

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js + Express.js
- MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for caching and session management
- JWT for authentication

### 2. Internal Module Boundaries

While implemented as a monolith, the application maintains clear module boundaries:

- **PDF Service Module**: Handles PDF conversion operations
- **Image Service Module**: Manages image processing
- **QR Service Module**: Generates and processes QR codes
- **Auth Module**: Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Payment Module**: Handles payment processing

Each module has a clear API interface that will facilitate future separation into microservices.

### 3. Frontend Application

A React single-page application (SPA) that provides:

- User interface for file uploads and conversions
- Profile and payment management
- File preview and download capabilities

**Technology Stack:**
- React with React Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- React Query for data fetching

### 4. File Storage

Files are stored in a structured file system with:

- Separate directories for uploads, processing, and downloads
- Temporary storage with automatic cleanup
- Secure access controls

For the MVP, files are stored on the local file system, but the implementation supports future migration to cloud storage solutions.

## Data Flow

1. **User Uploads File**: 
   - File is uploaded to the application server
   - File is stored in temporary storage
   - Processing task is created

2. **File Processing**:
   - Appropriate service module processes the file based on type
   - Processing results are stored
   - User is notified of completion

3. **File Retrieval**:
   - User requests processed file
   - Application verifies user permissions
   - File is served for download

## Scalability Considerations

Although the MVP uses a monolithic architecture, several design decisions support future scaling:

1. **Clear Module Boundaries**: Each functional area has well-defined interfaces
2. **Stateless Processing**: Core processing logic is stateless to support future distribution
3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Long-running tasks are handled asynchronously
4. **Database Schema Design**: Data model supports future sharding and distribution

## Security Features

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different application features
3. **File Security**: Secure file storage with access controls and automatic cleanup
4. **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive user data and payment information
5. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs

## Deployment Strategy

For the MVP, we'll use a simplified deployment approach:

1. **Single Server Deployment**: All components run on a single server
2. **Docker Containerization**: Application packaged as a Docker container
3. **Render/Vercel Hosting**: Simplifies deployment and operations
4. **Database as a Service**: MongoDB Atlas for data storage
5. **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployments from the main branch

## Future Evolution Path

This architecture is designed to evolve in the following stages:

1. **MVP (Current)**: Monolithic application with clear internal boundaries
2. **Stage 2**: Split frontend and backend, implement API gateway
3. **Stage 3**: Extract high-load services (PDF processing) into separate microservices
4. **Stage 4**: Complete microservices transformation based on scaling needs

## Monitoring and Operations

Even in the MVP, we implement basic monitoring:

1. **Application Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate levels
2. **Error Tracking**: Integration with Sentry for error monitoring
3. **Performance Metrics**: Basic performance metrics collection
4. **Health Checks**: Endpoints for system health verification

## Conclusion

This simplified monolithic architecture provides the optimal balance between rapid development and future scalability. By maintaining clear internal boundaries and following good design practices, we ensure that the MVP can evolve smoothly as business requirements grow without requiring a complete rewrite.
