# QuickSparks File Security Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive security strategy for handling files within the QuickSparks application, focusing on privacy, data protection, and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

As a file conversion service, QuickSparks handles potentially sensitive user documents. Our security strategy is designed to ensure these files are processed, stored, and managed securely throughout their lifecycle.

## Core Security Principles

1. **Minimal Retention**: Files are stored only as long as necessary
2. **Zero Knowledge**: System design prevents unnecessary access to file contents
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against breaches
4. **Least Privilege**: Access to files is strictly limited
5. **Transparent Policies**: Clear communication with users about file handling

## File Lifecycle Management

### 1. Upload Phase

- **Secure Transport**: All file uploads use HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- **Upload Validation**: Files are scanned for malware before processing
- **Size Limitations**: Enforced maximum file size limits
- **Type Restrictions**: Allowed file types strictly enforced
- **Metadata Stripping**: Removal of potentially sensitive metadata

### 2. Processing Phase

- **Isolated Processing**: Files processed in isolated environments
- **Memory Management**: Secure handling of file data in memory
- **Runtime Protection**: Application-level security measures
- **Conversion Integrity**: Validation of conversion results

### 3. Storage Phase

- **Encrypted Storage**: All files encrypted at rest
- **Secure Naming**: Files renamed to prevent information disclosure
- **Structured Storage**: Files stored in a strictly organized system
- **Access Control**: Comprehensive controls on file access

### 4. Retrieval Phase

- **Authenticated Access**: Files accessible only to authorized users
- **Temporary URLs**: Time-limited access links for downloads
- **Download Tracking**: Auditing of all file retrievals
- **Secure Delivery**: Files transmitted securely to end users

### 5. Deletion Phase

- **Automatic Expiry**: Files automatically deleted after defined periods
- **Secure Deletion**: Multiple-pass wiping of deleted files
- **Deletion Verification**: Confirmation of successful deletion
- **Backup Purging**: Deleted files also removed from backups

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Architecture

```
/storage
├── uploads/                 # Temporary storage for incoming files
│   └── [user-id]/           # Segregated by user
│       └── [upload-id]/     # Unique upload session
├── processing/              # Files currently being processed
│   └── [conversion-id]/     # Isolated by conversion job
├── completed/               # Processed files
│   └── [user-id]/           # Segregated by user
│       └── [conversion-id]/ # Organized by conversion
└── public/                  # Non-sensitive public resources
```

### File Encryption

1. **Encryption at Rest**:
   - AES-256 encryption for all stored files
   - Keys managed through a key management service
   - Regular key rotation

2. **Encryption Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   // Pseudocode for file encryption
   async function encryptFile(filePath, userId) {
     // Get user-specific encryption key
     const key = await keyService.getUserKey(userId);
     
     // Read file
     const fileData = await fs.readFile(filePath);
     
     // Generate initialization vector
     const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
     
     // Create cipher and encrypt
     const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv);
     const encrypted = Buffer.concat([
       cipher.update(fileData),
       cipher.final()
     ]);
     
     // Get authentication tag
     const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
     
     // Compose final encrypted file with metadata
     const encryptedFile = Buffer.concat([
       iv,
       authTag,
       encrypted
     ]);
     
     // Write encrypted file
     await fs.writeFile(filePath + '.enc', encryptedFile);
     
     // Delete original file
     await secureDelete(filePath);
     
     // Return metadata for database
     return {
       encryptionMethod: 'aes-256-gcm',
       hasIv: true,
       hasAuthTag: true,
       keyIdentifier: key.id
     };
   }
   ```

### Secure File Access

1. **Signed URLs**:
   - Time-limited, cryptographically signed URLs for file access
   - One-time use tokens where appropriate
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   // Pseudocode for generating secure download links
   function generateSecureDownloadUrl(fileId, userId, expiresInMinutes = 15) {
     // Get file metadata
     const file = await fileService.getFile(fileId, userId);
     
     if (!file || file.userId !== userId) {
       throw new Error('Access denied');
     }
     
     // Calculate expiration time
     const expiresAt = Date.now() + (expiresInMinutes * 60 * 1000);
     
     // Create payload
     const payload = {
       fileId,
       userId,
       exp: Math.floor(expiresAt / 1000)
     };
     
     // Sign with application secret
     const token = jwt.sign(payload, config.fileAccessSecret);
     
     // Generate URL
     return `${config.apiBaseUrl}/files/download/${fileId}?token=${token}`;
   }
   ```

### Automatic File Deletion

1. **Expiration Policy**:
   - Free users: Files deleted after 24 hours
   - Basic users: Files deleted after 7 days
   - Premium users: Files deleted after 30 days
   - Custom retention periods for enterprise users

2. **Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   // Pseudocode for scheduled file cleanup
   async function cleanupExpiredFiles() {
     // Find expired files
     const expiredFiles = await db.files.find({
       expiresAt: { $lt: new Date() },
       status: 'active'
     });
     
     // Process in batches to avoid system overload
     for (const batch of chunkArray(expiredFiles, 100)) {
       await Promise.all(batch.map(async file => {
         try {
           // Securely delete the file
           await secureDeleteFile(file.storagePath);
           
           // Update database record
           await db.files.updateOne(
             { _id: file._id },
             { 
               $set: { 
                 status: 'deleted',
                 deletedAt: new Date()
               } 
             }
           );
           
           // Log deletion for audit
           await auditLog.record({
             action: 'file_deleted',
             resourceId: file._id,
             userId: file.userId,
             reason: 'expiration'
           });
         } catch (error) {
           // Log error but continue with other files
           logger.error(`Failed to delete file ${file._id}`, error);
         }
       }));
     }
   }
   ```

### Secure File Deletion

1. **Multiple-Pass Deletion**:
   - Files overwritten with random data before deletion
   - File metadata removed from databases
   - Storage locations verified to be clear

2. **Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   // Pseudocode for secure file deletion
   async function secureDeleteFile(filePath) {
     // Verify file exists
     if (!await fileExists(filePath)) {
       return false;
     }
     
     // Get file size
     const stats = await fs.stat(filePath);
     const fileSize = stats.size;
     
     // Open file for writing
     const fd = await fs.open(filePath, 'w');
     
     try {
       // Multiple pass overwrite
       for (let pass = 0; pass < 3; pass++) {
         // Create buffer with random data
         const buffer = crypto.randomBytes(8192); // 8KB chunks
         
         // Write buffer repeatedly until file is overwritten
         let bytesWritten = 0;
         while (bytesWritten < fileSize) {
           const writeSize = Math.min(buffer.length, fileSize - bytesWritten);
           await fs.write(fd, buffer, 0, writeSize, bytesWritten);
           bytesWritten += writeSize;
         }
         
         // Flush to disk
         await fs.fsync(fd);
       }
     } finally {
       // Close file
       await fs.close(fd);
     }
     
     // Delete the overwritten file
     await fs.unlink(filePath);
     
     return true;
   }
   ```

## Access Controls

### User-Based Access

- Files are strictly segregated by user ID
- Users can only access their own files
- Administrative access is limited and audited

### Role-Based Permissions

- **Regular users**: Access only to their own files
- **Support staff**: Limited diagnostic access with user consent
- **Administrators**: Emergency access with full audit trail
- **System processes**: Minimal necessary access to perform conversions

### Authentication for File Operations

All file operations require proper authentication:

1. **Upload**: Valid user session and appropriate permissions
2. **Processing**: Internal service authentication
3. **Download**: Valid user session or secure time-limited token
4. **Deletion**: Valid user session with owner permissions

## Monitoring and Audit

### Comprehensive Logging

- All file operations logged with detailed metadata
- Logs securely stored and tamper-proof
- Regular log review and analysis

### Example Audit Events

```javascript
// Sample audit log entries
const auditEvents = [
  {
    action: 'file_uploaded',
    userId: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',
    resourceId: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439012',
    timestamp: '2023-03-15T14:30:45Z',
    details: {
      fileName: 'document.pdf',
      fileSize: 2457890,
      mimeType: 'application/pdf',
      ipAddress: '192.168.1.1'
    }
  },
  {
    action: 'file_downloaded',
    userId: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',
    resourceId: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439012',
    timestamp: '2023-03-15T15:45:22Z',
    details: {
      downloadMethod: 'direct_link',
      ipAddress: '192.168.1.1',
      userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0...'
    }
  },
  {
    action: 'file_deleted',
    userId: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',
    resourceId: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439012',
    timestamp: '2023-03-15T18:10:05Z',
    details: {
      deletionType: 'user_initiated',
      ipAddress: '192.168.1.1'
    }
  }
]
```
