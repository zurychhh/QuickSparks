## Contingency Planning

To mitigate risks and handle potential delays, the following contingency strategies are established:

### Time Buffer
Each milestone includes a 1-day buffer for unexpected issues, with an additional 3-day buffer for the overall project timeline.

### Feature Prioritization
Features are categorized using MoSCoW prioritization:
- **Must Have**: Critical for MVP launch
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Desirable if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Planned for future releases

If delays occur, "Could Have" features may be deferred to post-launch updates.

### Technical Alternatives
For high-risk components, alternative approaches are identified:
- **Conversion Libraries**: Secondary options identified if primary choices fail
- **Payment Processing**: Manual tracking option if PayByLink integration is delayed
- **Performance Optimization**: Progressive enhancement approach if full optimization cannot be completed

### Resource Flexibility
Team members are cross-trained on key components to allow for flexible resource allocation if specific areas require additional effort.

## Communication Plan

Clear communication around milestones will be maintained through:

1. **Daily Standups**: Quick status updates on current tasks
2. **Weekly Milestone Reviews**: Formal checkpoint of milestone progress
3. **Project Dashboard**: Real-time view of milestone status and metrics
4. **Slack Channel**: Dedicated channel for milestone discussions
5. **Documentation Updates**: Continuous updates to project documentation
