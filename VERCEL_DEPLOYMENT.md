# Vercel Deployment for PDFSpark

## Overview

We have successfully configured the PDFSpark frontend application for deployment on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions that enables developers to deploy web applications with zero configuration.

## Configuration Details

### Project Setup

The PDFSpark frontend is now fully configured for Vercel deployment with the following:

1. **Deployment Configuration**: Created `vercel.json` in the frontend package with:
   - SPA routing configuration (all routes redirect to index.html)
   - Build command specification
   - Output directory configuration
   - Framework identification (Vite)

2. **Environment Variables**: Set up environment examples in `.env.example` which should be configured in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: API service URL
   - `VITE_ENVIRONMENT`: Environment name (production, staging, etc.)
   - `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`: Error monitoring service connection string
   - `VITE_APP_VERSION`: Application version for tracking

3. **CI/CD Integration**: Created GitHub Actions workflow that:
   - Automatically deploys to production when changes are pushed to the main branch
   - Only triggers on relevant file changes to avoid unnecessary deployments
   - Uses Vercel CLI for streamlined deployment process

4. **Preview Environments**: Implemented preview deployment system that:
   - Creates unique preview URLs for each pull request
   - Adds comments to pull requests with preview links
   - Enables easy testing of changes before merging

## Deployment Architecture

The Vercel deployment setup follows modern best practices:

1. **Edge Network Distribution**: The frontend will be distributed across Vercel's global edge network for fast loading worldwide
2. **Serverless Functions Support**: API routes can be added as serverless functions if needed
3. **Immutable Deployments**: Each deployment creates an immutable snapshot, enabling easy rollbacks
4. **Branch-based Previews**: Every PR gets its own isolated preview environment

## Health Monitoring

The deployment includes a health monitoring system:

1. **Frontend Health Route**: Added a `/health` route that:
   - Shows system status information
   - Attempts to connect to the backend API
   - Reports Sentry integration status
   - Displays uptime and version information

2. **Error Reporting**: Integrated Sentry to:
   - Capture unhandled exceptions
   - Track frontend performance metrics
   - Group similar errors for easier debugging
   - Provide context for troubleshooting

## Security Considerations

The Vercel deployment includes several security enhancements:

1. **Environment Isolation**: Production and preview environments are completely isolated
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic is automatically secured with SSL/TLS
3. **Secret Management**: Sensitive variables are securely stored in Vercel's environment system, not in the codebase

## Production Readiness

The Vercel deployment setup is production-ready with:

1. **Reliability Features**:
   - Automatic scaling based on traffic
   - High availability across multiple regions
   - Content delivery optimization

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Asset compression and minification
   - Automatic caching strategies
   - Image optimization

3. **Monitoring Capabilities**:
   - Error tracking through Sentry
   - Deployment status notifications
   - Health check endpoints

## Next Steps

To complete the Vercel deployment:

1. **Account Creation**: Create a Vercel account for the organization
2. **Project Import**: Import the GitHub repository into Vercel
3. **Environment Configuration**: Set up the environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. **DNS Configuration**: Configure custom domain settings
5. **Team Access**: Set appropriate team member access levels

## Monorepo Configuration

This project uses a monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces, which requires special configuration in Vercel:

1. **Root vercel.json**: We've added a root `vercel.json` file that:
   - Specifies `installCommand: "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile"` to prevent lockfile validation failures
   - Sets `buildCommand` to build the frontend package specifically
   - Configures the correct `outputDirectory` to point to the frontend build output

2. **Workflow Modifications**: GitHub Actions workflows have been updated to:
   - Use `vercel pull` to get the latest project configuration
   - Run `vercel build` for local building
   - Use `vercel deploy --prebuilt` to deploy the locally built application

3. **Lockfile Handling**: To prevent issues with workspace dependencies or lockfile mismatches:
   - All install commands now use `--no-frozen-lockfile` flag
   - This is especially important for monorepos where packages may have interdependencies

4. **Testing Locally**: To test the Vercel deployment locally before pushing:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   vercel link # Link to your Vercel project
   vercel build
   vercel deploy --prebuilt
   ```

## Documentation

The deployment process is documented in:
- GitHub workflow files explaining the CI/CD process
- `docs/deployment.md` with detailed deployment instructions
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` (this document) with Vercel-specific details

This setup provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable deployment solution for the PDFSpark frontend application.
