Creating Automated Test Pipelines
Combine these tools in a CI/CD pipeline script:
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Web Application Test Suite

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # Unit & Integration Tests
      - name: Run Jest tests
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test

      # End-to-End Tests

          npx playwright install --with-deps
          npx playwright test

      # Accessibility Tests
      - name: Run accessibility tests

Essential Development Practices for Testability
1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Write tests before implementing features
2. Component-based architecture - Keep components isolated and testable
3. Clean code principles - Make code readable and maintainable
4. Continuous Integration - Test on every code change
5. Automated test reporting - Generate and analyze test reports
6. Test environment parity - Keep testing environments close to production
7. Feature flags - Control feature availability for testing in production
