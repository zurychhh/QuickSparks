Testing PDF Conversion

This is a simple text file that we'll use to create a test PDF document.

It includes:
- Some plain text
- A bulleted list
- Different formatting (bold and italic would be here)

Tables would also be included in a real document.

The goal is to test the conversion of these elements to DOCX format using different libraries.
