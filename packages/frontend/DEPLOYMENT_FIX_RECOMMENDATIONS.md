# PDFSpark Deployment Fix Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive deployment check completed on 26.03.2025, 11:06:22, here are the recommended fixes:

## Current Status

- Working URLs: 0/13
- URLs requiring authentication: 7
- URLs returning 404 (not found): 0
- URLs with errors: 0

## Identified Issues

1. **Vercel Deployment Limit**: We've hit the free tier limit of 100 deployments per day
2. **Domain Redirection**: quicksparks.dev redirects to www.quicksparks.dev, but the www subdomain is not properly configured
3. **Authentication Requirements**: Direct Vercel URLs require authentication

## Fix Recommendations

### Option 1: Wait for Quota Reset

- Wait until the Vercel deployment quota resets (typically 24 hours)
- Deploy the www subdomain fix using the deploy-www-fix.sh script
- Configure both apex and www domains in Vercel

### Option 2: Use Alternative Hosting

- Deploy to Netlify as an alternative to Vercel
- Create a netlify.toml configuration with proper redirects
- Deploy using the Netlify CLI

### Option 3: GitHub Pages Deployment

- Configure GitHub Pages for the repository
- Create a custom domain configuration
- Set up proper path prefixes

## Implementation Plan

1. Create Netlify deployment configuration
2. Deploy to Netlify as a fallback
3. Retry Vercel deployment after quota reset
4. Properly configure domain settings for both apex and www subdomains
5. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous deployment

## Verification Plan

After implementing the fix:
1. Test all URLs with the comprehensive check script
2. Verify both apex and www domain variants
3. Ensure proper routing with the /pdfspark path prefix
4. Confirm all assets load correctly (JavaScript, CSS, images)
