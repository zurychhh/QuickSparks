# PDFSpark 404 Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue

The application is encountering a 404 error when trying to access:
```
https://www.quicksparks.dev/pdfspark/
```

Error: `404: NOT_FOUND Code: NOT_FOUND ID: arn1::64g7k-1742917511904-03d480295eb8`

## Root Cause Analysis

When a 404 error occurs with a Vercel deployment, there are several potential causes:

1. **Deployment Configuration**: The project is correctly built and deployed but the configuration doesn't properly handle the `/pdfspark` path.

2. **Domain Configuration**: The domain is not properly configured to point to the right Vercel project.

3. **Rewrite Rules**: The rewrite rules in `vercel.json` may not be correctly set up for the subdirectory.

4. **Build Structure**: The build output may not have the correct structure for subdirectory hosting.

## Solutions We've Tried

We've implemented multiple solutions to address the issue:

1. **Updated vercel.json with rewrites**: 
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/pdfspark", "destination": "/pdfspark/index.html" },
       { "source": "/pdfspark/(.*)", "destination": "/pdfspark/$1" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Restructured build output**: Created a `/pdfspark` directory in the build output with all application files.

3. **Updated Vite configuration**: Set `base: '/pdfspark/'` in `vite.config.ts`.

4. **Updated React Router**: Set `basename="/pdfspark"` in the Router component.

## Comprehensive Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Test Direct Deployment URL

First, check if the application works on the direct Vercel deployment URL:

```
https://dist-h1cmn4tz7-zurychhhs-projects.vercel.app/pdfspark/
```

If this works, the issue is with the domain configuration. If not, the issue is with the deployment configuration.

### Step 2: Check Domain Configuration in Vercel

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard
2. Select the "dist" project
3. Go to "Settings" > "Domains"
4. Verify that "quicksparks.dev" is added as a domain
5. Check that the domain has a "Valid Configuration" status

### Step 3: Verify DNS Configuration

1. Run a DNS lookup on quicksparks.dev:
   ```
   dig quicksparks.dev
   ```
2. Verify that the A records point to Vercel's IP addresses
3. Check that there are no conflicting CNAME records

### Step 4: Check Vercel Rewrites

1. Go to "Settings" > "Rewrites" in the Vercel dashboard
2. Verify that the following rewrites exist:
   ```
   Source: /pdfspark
   Destination: /pdfspark/index.html
   
   Source: /pdfspark/(.*)
   Destination: /pdfspark/$1
   ```

### Step 5: Inspect Network Traffic

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Try accessing https://www.quicksparks.dev/pdfspark/
4. Look for the 404 response
5. Check the response headers for any clues

### Step 6: Force Cache Bypass

Try accessing the URL with a cache-busting parameter:
```
https://www.quicksparks.dev/pdfspark/?cache=bust
```

### Step 7: Try a Complete Redeployment

1. Go to "Deployments" in the Vercel dashboard
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the three dots menu and select "Redeploy"

## Last Resort Options

### Option 1: Create a New Project

If all else fails, consider creating a completely new Vercel project:

1. Run `vercel` from the frontend directory without linking to an existing project
2. Add the domain in the new project's settings
3. Configure rewrites as described above

### Option 2: Use Another Hosting Provider

Consider using another hosting provider like Netlify or GitHub Pages that might handle subdirectory deployments differently.

### Option 3: Use a Subdomain Instead

Instead of using a subdirectory, consider using a subdomain:
```
https://pdfspark.quicksparks.dev/
```

## Next Steps

If the issue persists after trying all these steps, consider reaching out to Vercel support with:

1. Your project ID (from .vercel/project.json)
2. A link to the direct deployment URL
3. Screenshots of your configuration
4. The exact error message you're receiving
