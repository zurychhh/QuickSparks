# PDFSpark Deployment: Next Steps

## Current Status
- End-to-end Selenium tests are successful and working with the real backend
- Application is deployed to Vercel and accessible at https://quicksparks.dev/pdfspark
- Custom domain configuration is working correctly
- TypeScript errors have been fixed in the conversion service

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Address Authentication Issues
- Verify authentication requirements for the application
- Ensure public routes are accessible without authentication
- Configure proper authentication flow for protected routes
- Test public and private routes separately

### 2. Set up Monitoring and Error Tracking
- Implement application monitoring with a service like Sentry or LogRocket
- Set up error tracking to catch and report client-side errors
- Configure performance monitoring for critical user flows
- Create alerts for important application metrics

### 3. Implement CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Configure automated Selenium tests as part of the pipeline
- Add deployment verification steps to ensure successful deployments
- Set up branch preview deployments for testing changes before merging

### 4. Expand Test Coverage
- Create additional Selenium tests for edge cases
- Implement tests for error scenarios (network issues, invalid files)
- Add tests for different browsers and screen sizes
- Set up periodic automated testing of the production environment

### 5. Optimize Performance
- Run Lighthouse audits to identify performance issues
- Implement lazy loading for large components
- Optimize asset delivery (images, fonts, etc.)
- Implement proper caching strategies

### 6. Set Up Analytics
- Add Google Analytics or similar service for tracking user behavior
- Create conversion funnels to measure critical user flows
- Track conversion metrics for key features
- Set up A/B testing capability for future improvements

### Implementation Plan
1. Start with monitoring setup to catch any current issues
2. Address authentication issues to ensure full public access
3. Set up CI/CD for automated deployments
4. Implement performance optimizations
5. Add analytics for user tracking
6. Expand test coverage for edge cases
