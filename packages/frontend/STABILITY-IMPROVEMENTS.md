# PDFSpark Stability Improvements

This document outlines the stability improvements implemented in Phase 2 of the PDFSpark code review project.

## 1. WebSocket Reconnection Strategy

### Implemented Features:
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive increase in wait time between reconnection attempts
- **Maximum Retry Limit**: Prevents infinite reconnection attempts
- **Reconnection Attempt Tracking**: Tracks and manages reconnection attempts
- **Stable Connection Detection**: Resets retry counters after a stable period
- **User Feedback**: Visual indicators showing connection status
- **Manual Reconnection**: Allows users to trigger manual reconnection

### Implementation Details:
- Created centralized WebSocket context for global state management
- Added comprehensive timer cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Implemented reconnect attempt tracking with useRef
- Added manual disconnect flag to prevent auto-reconnect when user initiates disconnect
- Normalized URL handling for improved cross-environment compatibility
- Enhanced error handling with Sentry integration

### Files Changed:
- `/packages/frontend/src/services/websocket.ts`
- `/packages/frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx` (new)
- `/packages/frontend/src/components/ui/WebSocketStatus.tsx` (new)

## 2. Standardized Error Handling

### Implemented Features:
- **Centralized Error Handler**: Common utility for consistent error handling
- **Error Classification**: Categorizes errors by type and status code
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Converts API errors to readable messages
- **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in Sentry error reporting
- **Try-Catch Wrapper**: Helper functions for async error handling
- **React Integration**: Custom hook for component-level error handling

### Implementation Details:
- Created ErrorInfo type with standardized error properties
- Implemented special handling for HTTP status codes (401, 402, etc.)
- Created useErrorHandler hook for React components
- Integrated with FeedbackContext for user notifications
- Added error dismissal functionality

### Files Changed:
- `/packages/frontend/src/utils/errorHandler.ts` (new)
- `/packages/frontend/src/hooks/useErrorHandler.ts` (new)
- `/packages/frontend/src/pages/Conversion.tsx`

## 3. Memory Management Improvements

### Implemented Features:
- **Ref-Based Resource Tracking**: Using refs to store and manage resources
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: All timeouts and intervals properly cleared
- **React Lifecycle Integration**: Proper cleanup in useEffect return functions
- **Resource Reference Management**: Ensured no dangling references

### Implementation Details:
- Standardized pattern for interval/timeout management with useRef
- Added explicit cleanup functions for all asynchronous operations
- Implemented component unmount detection to prevent state updates after unmount
- Enhanced WebSocket connection management with proper cleanup

## 4. Authentication Security (Phase 1)

### Implemented Features:
- **HttpOnly Cookies**: Replaced localStorage token storage with secure cookies
- **CSRF Protection**: Added token-based protection for state-changing operations
- **Auth Middleware**: Support for both cookie and header-based authentication
- **Auth Context**: Centralized authentication state management

### Implementation Details:
- Created AuthContext for React components
- Updated authentication status checks to use secured endpoints
- Added logout functionality with proper cookie clearing
- Integrated authentication with WebSocket connections

### Files Changed:
- `/packages/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (new)
- `/packages/frontend/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Resource Management**:
   - All resources are properly tracked and cleaned up
   - No memory leaks from dangling timers or listeners

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error handling across components
   - User-friendly error messages with appropriate feedback
   - Detailed error logging for debugging

3. **State Management**:
   - Centralized contexts for shared state
   - Component-level state for isolated concerns
   - Proper propagation of state changes

4. **Security**:
   - CSRF protection for state-changing operations
   - HttpOnly cookies for authentication tokens
   - Secure connection management

5. **Performance**:
   - Efficient reconnection strategies
   - Batched state updates where appropriate
   - Memoization of expensive calculations

6. **User Experience**:
   - Informative status indicators
   - Clear error messages with actionable feedback
   - Consistent loading and progress states
