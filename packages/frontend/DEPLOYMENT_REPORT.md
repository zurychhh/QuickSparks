   - Verified application loads in modern browsers
   - Tested with and without third-party cookies

3. **Post-Deployment Checks**:
   - Manual verification of deployed application
   - Console error monitoring
   - Functional testing of conversion features

## Next Steps

1. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Set up a custom domain for the application
   - Configure SSL certificates

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Set up error tracking
   - Add automated browser testing of deployed application

3. **CI/CD**:
   - Configure automated CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up automated testing for PRs
   - Include post-deployment verification tests

## Conclusion

The PDFSpark application is now fully tested and deployed with all critical functionality working against a real backend, as requested. The Selenium tests provide comprehensive validation of the conversion functionality, ensuring the application works correctly in production.
