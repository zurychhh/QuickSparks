# PDFSpark Deployment and API Integration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

1. **API Configuration Issues**:
   - Fixed API endpoint configuration in `api.config.ts` to correctly point to the backend service
   - Added proper URL path normalization for API requests
   - Updated `getConversionStatus`, `getDownloadToken`, and file upload functions to use normalized paths

2. **React Hooks Violations**:
   - Fixed `handleRemoveFile` and `handleDownload` functions in `Conversion.tsx` to use component-level `useFeedback` hook
   - This resolves the React hooks rules violations where hooks were called conditionally

3. **Vercel Deployment Configuration**:
   - Updated `vercel.json` to properly handle API proxy requests
   - Added correct CORS headers for API requests
   - Configured proper Content-Type headers for JavaScript files
   - Set up SPA fallback route for HashRouter

4. **Build Configuration**:
   - Updated `vite.config.ts` to use relative paths
   - Fixed asset loading with proper base path

5. **HashRouter Implementation**:
   - Added `hash-router-monitor.js` to help debug routing issues
   - Ensured HashRouter is properly implemented in main.tsx
   - Removed conflicting BrowserRouter from App.tsx

6. **Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging**:
   - Added detailed error logging for API requests 
   - Added specific handling for common HTTP status codes (404, 405, 500)
   - Added WebSocket connection logging
   - Added upload progress tracking with detailed logs

## Files Modified

1. `/src/config/api.config.ts`: Updated API endpoint URLs
2. `/src/services/websocket.ts`: Enhanced WebSocket URL handling and logging
3. `/src/services/api.ts`: Added API request error handling and URL normalization
4. `/src/pages/Conversion.tsx`: Fixed React hooks usage
5. `/dist/index.html`: Added hash-router-monitor script
6. `/vercel.json`: Updated API proxy configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. Build the application with updated configurations:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Copy the updated `vercel.json` to the dist directory:
   ```bash
   cp vercel.json dist/
   ```

3. Deploy the dist directory to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel deploy --prod dist
   ```

4. Verify the deployment by checking:
   - The frontend loads correctly at quicksparks.dev
   - API requests are properly proxied to the backend
   - File upload and conversion functionality works

## Testing Notes

- Test file uploads with both PDF and DOCX files
- Check conversion process works end-to-end
- Verify download functionality
- Check for any browser console errors related to API requests
- Test file removal functionality

## Monitoring

- Monitor browser console logs for any API request errors
- Check Sentry for captured exceptions
- Monitor backend API logs for any unusual error patterns
- Track conversion success rates

These fixes should address all the critical issues identified in the CONVERSION_PAGE_ISSUES.md document, particularly the file removal functionality, API connectivity, and overall conversion process.

## Previous Deployment Status

We've successfully implemented the end-to-end Selenium tests with real backend integration, but deployment has encountered account limitations:

- **Vercel Deployment Limit**: The account has reached the free tier deployment limit (100 deployments per day)
- **Authentication Issues**: The deployed applications appear to require authentication
- **Alternative Deployment**: For full testing, we recommend deploying to a different hosting platform or waiting for the quota to reset
- **Repository**: Updated with Selenium tests and TypeScript fixes
- **Branch**: feature/purchase-flow

## End-to-End Testing

1. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Created comprehensive Selenium tests for PDF to DOCX and DOCX to PDF conversions
   - All tests run against the real backend (no mock mode)
   - Tests generate detailed reports and diagnostics

2. **Test Results**:
   - PDF to DOCX conversion works with real backend âœ…
   - DOCX to PDF conversion works with real backend âœ…
   - Proper file upload and download functionality âœ…
   - WebSocket real-time updates work correctly âœ…

## Next Steps

1. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Set up a custom domain for the application
   - Configure SSL certificates

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Set up error tracking
   - Add automated browser testing of deployed application

3. **CI/CD**:
   - Configure automated CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up automated testing for PRs
   - Include post-deployment verification tests
