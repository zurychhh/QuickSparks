# PDFSpark Deployment Notes

## Current Deployment Status

The application has been successfully deployed to Vercel, but there are some issues with domain configuration that need to be addressed.

### Deployment URLs

- Direct Vercel URL: https://dist-642u13vwq-zurychhhs-projects.vercel.app
- Expected Production URL: https://quicksparks.dev/pdfspark

### Issues Identified

1. **Authorization Issues**: The direct Vercel URL is returning 401 Unauthorized errors
2. **Domain Configuration**: The quicksparks.dev domain may not be properly configured in Vercel
3. **Path Configuration**: The /pdfspark path needs proper configuration in Vercel

## Next Steps to Fix Deployment

1. **Fix Authorization Issues**:
   - Check Vercel project settings for any authorization requirements
   - Verify that the project is set to public, not requiring authentication

2. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Go to the Vercel dashboard and select the project
   - Go to "Settings" > "Domains"
   - Add "quicksparks.dev" as a domain
   - If it asks for configuration, select "I'm using a different provider"
   - Add appropriate DNS records (A or CNAME) to point to Vercel

3. **Path Configuration**:
   - In the project settings, go to "Rewrites" and add:
     - Source: /pdfspark
       Destination: /pdfspark/index.html
     - Source: /pdfspark/(.*)
       Destination: /pdfspark/$1

4. **Verify Security Headers**:
   - Ensure security headers are properly configured in vercel.json
   - Redeploy after confirming header configuration

## Task 17 Implementation Status

Despite the deployment issues, the implementation for Task 17 has been successfully completed:

1. **Production Deployment Tooling**:
   - Created a controlled deployment process with verification steps
   - Added deployment approval process and verification logging
   - Enhanced the deployment scripts with additional validation

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Set up Sentry release tracking for error monitoring
   - Implemented Web Vitals tracking for performance metrics
   - Created a metrics collection utility for tracking key metrics
   - Added a dashboard generator to visualize monitoring data
   - Configured alerting thresholds for critical metrics

3. **A/B Testing Framework**:
   - Implemented a flexible A/B testing framework
   - Created user assignment persistence
   - Added result tracking for experiments
   - Created a React hook for easy integration in components
   - Set up initial A/B tests for key application areas

4. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Created a metrics collector for categorized metrics
   - Set up tracking for performance, business, technical, and conversion metrics
   - Integrated metrics with Google Analytics and Sentry
   - Defined key business metrics in monitoring configuration

5. **Conversion Quality Monitoring**:
   - Implemented a dedicated quality monitoring system
   - Created metrics for tracking conversion quality
   - Set up quality distribution analytics
   - Added alerting for poor conversion quality

## Additional Verification Steps

Once the domain issues are resolved, run these checks:

1. **Final Deployment Verification**:
   ```
   APP_URL=https://quicksparks.dev/pdfspark node tools/verify-deployment.mjs
   ```

2. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   ```
   npm run setup-monitoring
   ```

3. **Generate Dashboard**:
   ```
   npm run generate-dashboard
   ```

4. **Collect Initial Metrics**:
   Monitor the application for at least 1 week to collect baseline metrics.
