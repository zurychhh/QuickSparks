# Task 16 Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 16 "Finalizacja konfiguracji produkcyjnej" from the PDFSpark project tasklist.

## Completed Tasks

### 16.1. Production Configuration Finalization
- Enhanced Vercel configuration with security headers:
  - Added `Strict-Transport-Security` header for HTTPS enforcement
  - Added `X-Content-Type-Options` header to prevent MIME type sniffing

  - Added `X-XSS-Protection` header for XSS protection
  - Added `Referrer-Policy` header to control referrer information
  - Added `Permissions-Policy` header to restrict browser features
- Added root path redirect to `/pdfspark` for better user experience
- Configured GitHub integration settings for silent deployments

### 16.2. Documentation Preparation
- Created comprehensive user documentation (USER_GUIDE.md):
  - Getting started guide
  - Feature explanations
  - Account management
  - Subscription plans
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - FAQ section
- Created technical documentation (TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md):
  - Architecture overview
  - Frontend structure
  - Deployment instructions
  - Testing procedures
  - Monitoring configuration
  - Extension guides

### 16.3. Domain and SSL Configuration
- Updated Vercel configuration to support custom domain
- Configured SSL/TLS security best practices:
