This document outlines the procedures and responsibilities for responding to incidents affecting the PDFSpark application. An "incident" is defined as any unplanned interruption or degradation of service that impacts users or poses a security risk.

## Incident Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Resolution Target | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| P0 - Critical | Complete service outage or security breach | Immediate (15 min) | 2 hours | Website down, data breach |
| P1 - High | Major functionality broken affecting many users | 1 hour | 4 hours | Payment processing fails, conversion broken |
| P2 - Medium | Limited functionality issues affecting some users | 4 hours | 24 hours | Slow conversions, minor UI issues |
| P3 - Low | Minor issues with minimal impact | 24 hours | 72 hours | Cosmetic defects, non-critical bugs |

- **Team Assembly**: Alert appropriate team members based on severity
- **Initial Documentation**: Start incident log in the shared document

### 3. Investigation

- **Establish War Room**: Set up communication channel (Slack/Zoom)
- **Gather Information**: Collect logs, error reports, user feedback
- **Form Hypothesis**: Identify potential root causes
- **Test Theories**: Validate hypotheses with data and testing

### 4. Mitigation

- **Immediate Actions**: Implement temporary fixes to restore service
- **User Communication**: Update status page and notify users if needed
- **Progress Updates**: Regular updates to stakeholders (15-30 min intervals for P0/P1)
- **Validation**: Confirm mitigation measures are effective

### 5. Resolution

- **Permanent Fix**: Implement and deploy long-term solution
- **Verification**: Confirm all affected systems are fully functional
- **All Clear**: Declare incident resolved
- **User Notification**: Update users on resolution

### 6. Post-Incident

- **Incident Review**: Conduct post-mortem within 48 hours
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Document the underlying causes
- **Action Items**: Identify preventative measures and improvements
- **Documentation**: Update runbooks and knowledge base
