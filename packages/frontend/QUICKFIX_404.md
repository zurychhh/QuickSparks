# QuickFix: Resolving 404 Error at quicksparks.dev/pdfspark

## The Problem

We're encountering a 404 error when trying to access https://www.quicksparks.dev/pdfspark/. This indicates that while our application is correctly built and deployed to Vercel, the domain configuration is not properly set up to route the /pdfspark path to our application.

## Root Cause Analysis

The 404 error is happening because:

1. The domain quicksparks.dev is likely managed by a separate Vercel project
2. That project doesn't have proper routing rules to handle the /pdfspark path
3. Our deployment exists as a standalone project, not integrated with the main domain

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Configure Path Rewrites in Main Project (Recommended)

1. Identify the Vercel project that hosts quicksparks.dev
2. Add these rewrites to that project:
   ```
   Source: /pdfspark
   Destination: /pdfspark/index.html
   
   Source: /pdfspark/(.*)
   Destination: /pdfspark/$1
   ```
3. Upload our built files to the /pdfspark directory in that project

### Option 2: Deploy as Standalone Subdomain

1. Deploy our application to its own domain like pdfspark.quicksparks.dev
2. Configure DNS for the subdomain
3. Update the application to use root paths instead of /pdfspark prefix

### Option 3: Use Vercel Edge Middleware

1. Create a Vercel Edge Middleware function in the main project
2. Configure it to proxy requests from /pdfspark to our standalone deployment

## Immediate Action Steps

Run the diagnostic tool to identify the main project:

```bash
npm run check:domain
```

Then choose one of these options:

### For Option 1 (Main Project Integration):

```bash
npm run integrate:domain
```
This will:
- Build the application with correct subdirectory settings
- Generate a ZIP package of the build
- Create detailed integration instructions

### For Option 2 (Standalone Deployment):

```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```
Then in Vercel dashboard:
- Add custom domain: pdfspark.quicksparks.dev

## Verification

After implementing the fix, verify by testing:

- https://www.quicksparks.dev/pdfspark/product

## Long-term Recommendation

For future deployments, consider:
1. Consolidating into a single Vercel project with proper path routing
2. Setting up CI/CD for automatic deployments
3. Documenting the deployment process for the team
